<h3>About MCQS Quiz Game</h3>
<p>A multiple-choice question (MCQ) is composed of two parts: a stem that identifies the question or problem, and a set of alternatives or possible answers that contain a key that is the best answer to the question, and several distractors that are plausible but incorrect answers to the question.</p>

<p>If you thought that a multiple-choice question only includes a typical question with four options, you might be wrong. You will be surprised to know that at least 12 different types of MCQs can be used for different purposes.</p>
